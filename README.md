# Enabling and Configuring Buffer Log
In Buffered Logging messages are stored in a routerâ€™s memory buffer (DRAM); when buffer is full older messages are overwritten by new messages. When the router reboots, logging messages are erased.

To show the configurations available for buffered logging the following command will be used:
```
logging buffered ?
```
